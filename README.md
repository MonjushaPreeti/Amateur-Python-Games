Welcome to my Amateur Python Games repository! 🕹️
This is a collection of simple and amateur games that I created while learning Python and Tkinter. Each game holds a special place in my coding journey as they helped me build my skills and have some fun along the way! 😊

# Games Included
## Hangman 🤔
A classic word-guessing game! Can you save the stick figure before it's too late?

## Dice Throwing 🎲
Roll the dice and see what luck has in store for you! Simple but fun!

## Egg Catcher 🥚
Catch as many falling eggs as you can without missing! Be quick, or you might crack a few!

## Screenpet 🐾
Ever wanted your own virtual pet? Now you can have one right on your screen! Take care of it, and keep it happy!

## Smart Calculator 🧠
Not just any calculator—this one is a bit smarter! It can handle more than just simple math. Give it a try and see what it can do!

# Why This Repo?
I made these games while learning Python, and they helped me practice logic, user interface design (thanks, Tkinter!), and of course, the art of debugging! 🐛 I hope they bring you some fun as well!

Feel free to fork this repo and add your own games, or improve these ones.🤝

# Disclaimer: 
These are beginner-level projects, so they might not be the most polished or complex, but they were a lot of fun to make!
